    <h2>The beginning:</h2>
    <p>Maryam and Yasina, two little best friends, had always dreamed of visiting a tropical paradise.
         One day, their dream came true when they boarded a plane from Tashkent to Phuket, their hearts filled with excitement. 
         The flight was long—almost seven hours—but the girls didn’t mind. 
         They spent their time looking out of the window, watching the fluffy white clouds and imagining the adventures waiting for them in Thailand.</p>
