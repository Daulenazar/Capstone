    <p>Of course, no trip was complete without tasting delicious treats! 
        The girls loved trying different flavors of ice cream—coconut, mango, and even a strange but tasty purple one.

        The markets were full of souvenirs, and the girls each picked a small, handmade elephant figurine to take home.</p>
